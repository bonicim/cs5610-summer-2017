# Description

Current online dating apps such as Tinder or OkCupid attempt to pair men and women through a simple wait-and-see model; in other words, a user posts a profile and waits for a response, hoping that a simple chat leads to an actual date. The problem with such dating apps is that there is little screening of users who are serious and want to go on dates; and/or users who are not serious and fail to show up on dates or give a bad date experience. My application seeks to solve this problem by changing the way in which men and women meet online. My application will be an online dating website in which men post a profile showing their interests and how serious they are into dating; in turn, women will be given a list of eligible men and then initiate a chat with a chosen man, which could lead to an actual, serious date. Men only get to view profiles of women that are interested in them. In short, women make the first move.  

# Actors
There are two actors in my system: ladies (women) and suitors (men). Ladies are women who are looking for men to date; these women want to protect their identity and are also serious about dating. Their goal is to minimize the number of bad dates and not waste their time on “losers”. Suitors are men who are looking to date women; these men are serious daters who are sincere in giving a good date experience. Their goal is to meet serious and strong women who aren’t afraid to make the first move.
